## MVP

1. Access a Sqlite3 database using Active Record.

2. There are three models with a one to many relationship.

3. There is a simple React frontend app with 3 CRUD abilities (GET, POST, DELETE)

4. Styling has been made with "MaterialUI" and CSS.

## "As a user..."

1. I want to see all the concerts in the home page.

2. I want to add a concert with: title, date, artist name, venue.

3. I want to remove any concert i want from the database.
